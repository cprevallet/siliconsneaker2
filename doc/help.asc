== Program Purpose

The purpose of this program is to display graphs, a map, and summary information for runs generated by a GPS watch
that stores files in the Fit Format.

Most Garmin watches and several other brands support the FIT format
(ref: https://medium.com/decathlondigital/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04).

The program is GPL licensed and open-source.

SiliconSneaker2 is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the original SiliconSneaker in the Rust programming language.

====

The latest release builds are available for download here:

https://github.com/cprevallet/siliconsneaker2/releases

SiliconSneaker2 is open source software. The actual program code for this
software to view and modify is online at Github.

=== Installing on Windows(64 bit)

As of this writing, there is no installation routine (e.g setup.exe on Windows) yet available.  Installation is a performed
simply by downloading the compressed file 'SiliconSneaker2.Windows.x64.v0.4.2-alpha.zip' to a folder with
read-write access and extracting it. The "My Documents" or "Downloads" folder under Windows are good
choices (but not manadatory - any folder with read-write access will suffice).

Once the file is extracted (unzipped), installation is complete.

=== Installing on GNU/Linux(64 bit)

As of this writing, there is no are no compiled binaries available. See below for an example of compiling the program from source on Debian Linux.

A desktop application menu link will be created (under Accessories) to start SiliconSneaker2.

== Making FIT files Available On a PC

Now that the program has been installed, SiliconSneaker2 needs information on your activity in the form of a Fit files generated
from your sports watch. 
In general, Fit files may be made available in one of two ways - directly
from a device or downloaded through an online service.

=== From a watch
Instructions for moving a Fit file available to the PC from the device vary according
to the manufacturer and model of the individual watch.  Any description
given here will by necessity be incomplete. Some general information on Garmin
devices - those familiar to the author, additional information gladly accepted - are given here:

* Devices using Ant Agent to download files: Forerunner 50, 60, 70,
310XT, 405, 405CX, 410, 610, 910, 910XT, and Garmin Swim
* Devices using a docking cradle to download files: Forerunner/Edge 205
and 305
* Devices using a USB cable to download files (preferred): Forerunner/Edge 10, 110,
210, 220, 620, 500, 510, 705, 800, 810, 1000, and 920XT. Newer Garmin devices support the USB option which tends to be less
problematic than older Ant Agent transfers.

=== From an online service
* Strava downloads only provide TCX files.  TCX files may be converted to Fit files according
to various online sources.
* Garmin Connect provides (or used to provide) FIT downloads.  See this reference:
https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917807-Exporting-Files-from-Garmin-Connect

=== On the PC

==== Drivers

* Windows:  Devices that support the USB protocol are often recognized
automatically on Windows after it downloads the appropriate drivers.
* Linux: Most newer kernels contain the GARMIN_GPS module as a driver.  In addition to this,
 in order to affect transfers, the media transfer protocol (MTP) must be installed. For example
 on Debian Linux:
[source,console]
----
sudo apt install libmtp-runtime
----

==== File locations

* Media Transfer Protocol via USB:
  ** Connect your watch to the USB cable and ensure the cable is
  plugged into your computer and wait for your computer to recognize the
  device. Files may be loaded directly from the watch in this
  configuration.
  ** <DRIVE>\Primary\Garmin\Activity\

== Locating and Starting the Application

On Linux, there should be a menu item to start the application after installation.

On Windows there will be no menu item or icon (yet, until I build a setup program).  To start the program,
you must drill down to the file siliconsneaker2.exe.  It will be located within the directory you chose in the
installation step under the bin folder. Double click on the .exe to start but read the tip below first.

.Locate the file under the bin folder.  This bear wishes he owned a sports watch.

[IMPORTANT]
====
SiliconSneaker2 is currently only offered as an unsigned binary (a signing certificate costs money which is a problem
 for a small hobby project).  As a result, when running the program under Windows, Windows Defender will issue a warning about
 an unrecognized app. If you have downloaded this from Github, it should be safe to ignore this warning.  Click 
 "More Info" and "Run" to start SiliconSneaker2.

== Loading the Fit File

Now that the files are available to the PC by whatever means.  It's time to load them into SiliconSneaker2.  It's also a good time
to select your preferred unit system.  It can be changed anytime before or after a file has been loaded.
Side note: SiliconSneaker2 has only read access to the FIT file and cannot change it.

[TIP]
====
After the file loads, don't worry if the program window looks messy (compacted) on the first run.  Simply resize the window so that
it looks good on your monitor.  SiliconSneaker2 will retain your layout preferences on the next run. It's also a good time
to select your preferred unit system.  The preferred unit system will also be retained on subsequent program runs.

====

.Don't panic! Resize the window and carry on.

.O.K. that's better.  We're up and running. Goodbye Mr. Bear.

At this point, explore the interface.  Good luck.

== Usage

=== Using the application

[TIP]
====
Letting your mouse hover for about a half second over various parts of the interface will cause
useful tooltips describing the function of the elements will appear.  Let them guide your way!
====

[TIP]
====
You may not want to see all of the information at the same time.
The three individual "panes" of the windows may be resized so that any
portion of the interface is hidden from view.  For example if you are
just interested in the map function.  It may be resized to fill the entire
window (including the controls on the left).  Simply drag a hidden window pane's
edge to restore the view within it.  Similarly the Summary and Graph panes
 may be hidden or displayed as preferred. The program will remember these choices.  
====

[TIP]
====
The slider controls may be moved either via the mouse or keyboard.  The arrow keys and
page up and page down keys control the movement from the keyboard.
====

[TIP]
====
Use the top slider to zoom the graphs' y-axis.
====

[TIP]
====
Use the bottom slider to advance through a run. Note the indications on the map and graphs.
====

[TIP]
====
If your fitness activity is dated to one of several holidays, the runner marker on the
map will change to something indicate the holiday.
