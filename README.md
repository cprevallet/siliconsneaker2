# SiliconSneaker2
Display graphs, a map, and summary information for runs generated by a Garmin-brand GPS watch. The program is GPL licensed and open-source.

SiliconSneaker2 is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the original SiliconSneaker in the Rust programming language.

Note:
Support for TCX files has not been provided in this version.  The original SiliconSneaker
(https://github.com/cprevallet/siliconsneaker)  may be used for viewing files of this type.

# Running
A Garmin running watch must first be plugged directly into a computer USB port with the appropriate charging/data connector.  
Fenix: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/107531#overview  
Forerunner: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/620328#devices  
Once plugged in, the Garmin watch should mount itself as a USB device and present a file system to the host PC.  Individual activities (runs) may be viewed when FIT files are opened from within the program.  
For some watches under Windows 10 it may be necessary to install Garmin Express in order that the watch be recognized as a USB devices.  Details here:
